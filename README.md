Bewildered, Lyra laid eyes on the grainy, indistinct dark blue image on the screen in front of her. She tried to make sense of it for a while, but about half a minute later, she realised that there was no point, and asked no one in particular, "What the fuck is this? And why does it glitch every couple of seconds?"

"This is art", an unknown voice said. Lyra's heart skipped a beat.

"It's also a landing page."
